                        <h2>G-Project and Jay</h2>
                        <p>As adventure-loving fans of the outdoors and the thrill-seeking lifestyle it has to offer, we set out to capture and tell stories through breathtaking photography inspired by California culture. So we teamed up with photographer Jay Watson to bring you a series of photos that embrace Get Out And Play and showcase the beautiful environments our products are designed to play in. We first discovered Jay's work online (thank you, Pinterest!) and became immediate fans and then friends. We love his ability to capture authentic and often gritty moments and make them stunningly beautiful. See below to learn more about Jay Watson.</p>
                        <p>A special shout out to skateboarder Evelyn Abad, Ed Fladung of Quality Peoples and surfers Justin Knowles and Tommy Romero for being a part of the Jay Watson for G-Project photography series.</p>
